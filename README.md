# Mini Mart Frontend

A React single-page experience inspired by the provided mock, built to pair with a Java Spring Boot backend and SSO authentication.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite serves the app at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Notes
- The Login button is prepared for SSO and can be wired to your Java Spring Boot auth redirect.
- Cart and navigation buttons are visually styled and ready for backend integration.
